## Features

Web of Devs surfaces developer websites in a browsable directory, with **sort and filter** options to narrow the list by programming language, GitHub follower count, or repository stars. Each entry renders an embedded **live preview** of the site alongside the author's name, profile image, and language tags.

Signed-in users can **favorite** the sites they like to keep a personal collection, **submit their own site** by linking a GitHub account, and **report** entries that don't meet the submission criteria. Profile metadata, programming languages, and star counts are pulled directly from GitHub and refreshed on a schedule, so the directory stays current without manual curation.

## Architecture

The frontend is a [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) app written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss). End-to-end tests run with [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).

The backend is a [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) service that exposes a REST API for entries, favorites, reports, and authentication. [Knex](https://github.com/knex/knex) manages PostgreSQL schema migrations and queries. Background jobs (most notably the GitHub scraper that refreshes user metadata through GitHub's REST API) run on a [BullMQ](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq) queue backed by Redis, scheduled with `@nestjs/schedule`.

Authentication uses GitHub OAuth, with short-lived JWT access tokens and rotating refresh tokens. The NestJS API returns the tokens in the JSON response to the SvelteKit server (a trusted backend-for-frontend), which sets them as HttpOnly cookies on the browser response, so the refresh token is never exposed to client-side JavaScript. Rate limiting (`@nestjs/throttler`), `helmet`, and standard CORS protections are applied at the API boundary.

## Development

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be installed on your system. Check the [`.node-version`](.node-version) file for the recommended Node.js version.

Start PostgreSQL and Redis locally:

```bash
cd server
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Run the server (port 3001 by default):

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Run the client (port 3000):

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

- Client routes are in [`client/src/routes`](client/src/routes) and shared UI in [`client/src/components`](client/src/components)
- Server modules are in [`server/src`](server/src), with the GitHub scraper in [`server/src/scraper.service.ts`](server/src/scraper.service.ts)
- Database migrations are in [`server/migrations`](server/migrations)
